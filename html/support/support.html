    <h1>Support This Initiative</h1>

    <p class="intro">
        This platform is a long-term knowledge project inspired by the Bhagavad Gita.
        Its purpose is not religious promotion, but to present the Gita as a source of
        practical wisdom, clarity, and inner understanding that can be explored by anyone.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class="intro">This website is being developed in three phases:</p>

    <br>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Phase 1 (Current):</strong> Static, carefully structured, readable content.</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Login system, feedback features, and discussion spaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> An AI-based system inspired by the Bhagavad Gita.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p class="intro">Support for this project helps with:</p>

    <br>

    <ul>
        <li>Website maintenance and hosting</li>
        <li>Design, performance, and structure improvements</li>
        <li>Content expansion and future development</li>
        <li>Sustaining long-term focus and effort<br></li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p class="intro">
        A portion of the support may also be used for personal sustainability,
        allowing continued learning and long-term commitment to this initiative.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class="intro">
        Support is completely voluntary. There is no minimum amount and no restriction
        on access if you choose not to support.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class="intro">
        Whether you choose to support or simply read and reflect, both are equally respected.
