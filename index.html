            <h1>Timeless Knowledge for a Modern World</h1>

            <p>
                The Bhagavad Gita is often misunderstood as a religious scripture meant only for worship or belief.
                In reality, it is a deeply structured body of knowledge that explores <strong>human psychology, duty, action,
                and inner stability</strong>. It does not focus on rituals or blind faith, but on understanding the nature of
                conflict—both external and internal—and responding to it with clarity.
            </p>

            <p>
                The depth of this text has attracted thinkers far beyond spiritual traditions. Mahatma Gandhi viewed
                the Gita as a guide for ethical action and inner strength. Swami Vivekananda emphasized its message of
                strength, fearlessness, and self-mastery. Even modern intellectuals like Aldous Huxley and
                J. Robert Oppenheimer approached the Gita as a serious philosophical work dealing with duty,
                consequence, and responsibility.

                This platform presents the Bhagavad Gita not as doctrine, but as <strong>practical knowledge</strong>—
                to be read with reason, understood with clarity, and applied thoughtfully in real life.

            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>
                This website is an ongoing, multi-phase project aimed at presenting the Bhagavad Gita
                as a structured body of knowledge rather than a religious instruction.
                The current version represents <strong>Phase 1</strong>, which focuses on
                carefully curated, readable content—shlokas, narrative understanding, and practical guidance.
            </p>
            <p>
                In upcoming phases, this platform will evolve further.
                <strong>Phase 2</strong> will introduce user accounts, feedback systems, and discussion spaces.
                <strong>Phase 3</strong> will integrate AI-based interaction rooted in the Bhagavad Gita,
                enabling deeper and long-form conversations with the text.
