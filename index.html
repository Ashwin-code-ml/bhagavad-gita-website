            <h1>Timeless Knowledge for a Modern World</h1>

            <p>
                The Bhagavad Gita is often misunderstood as a religious scripture meant only for worship or belief.
                In reality, it is a deeply structured body of knowledge that explores human psychology, duty, action,
                and inner stability. It does not focus on rituals or blind faith, but on understanding the nature of
                conflict—both external and internal—and responding to it with clarity.
            </p>

            <p>
                The depth of this text has attracted thinkers far beyond spiritual traditions. Mahatma Gandhi viewed
                the Gita as a guide for ethical action and inner strength. Swami Vivekananda emphasized its message of
                strength, fearlessness, and self-mastery. Even modern intellectuals like Aldous Huxley and
                J. Robert Oppenheimer approached the Gita as a serious philosophical work dealing with duty,
                consequence, and responsibility.
            </p>

            <p>
                This platform presents the Bhagavad Gita not as doctrine, but as practical knowledge—
                to be read with reason, understood with clarity, and applied thoughtfully in real life.

    <h2>About This Project</h2>

    <p>
        This website is an ongoing, multi-phase project aimed at presenting the Bhagavad Gita
        as a structured body of knowledge rather than a religious instruction.
        The current version represents <strong>Phase 1</strong>, which focuses on
        carefully curated, readable content—shlokas, narrative understanding, and practical guidance.
    </p>

    <p>
        In upcoming phases, this platform will evolve further.
        <strong>Phase 2</strong> will introduce user accounts, feedback systems, and discussion spaces.
        <strong>Phase 3</strong> will integrate AI-based interaction rooted in the Bhagavad Gita,
        enabling deeper and long-form conversations with the text.
    </p>
